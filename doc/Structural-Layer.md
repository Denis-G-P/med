#2. Structural layer

This is the most fuzzy and spread layer without explicit structure and only part of it is defined within its own sub-namespace `med::sl`. However this layer is only needed changes when a new container or a new conditional added to the library. Thus a user of the library doesn't have to gain any knowledge of it.
